## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Still lots to learn with JavaScript. Google is my very best friend and helps tremendously along with Stackoverflow


### Useful resources

- [https://stackoverflow.com/a/6655622](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6655622) - Recycled this code to keep the selected rating option active upon clicking.

Had to scan through a couple challenge submissions to understand how to configure the JS for the rating system.
